# 🌿 EmergentPatterns

*A creative exploration of nature’s algorithms — brought to life through code.*

---

## 🧬 Overview

**EmergentPatterns** is a collection of interactive simulations and creative coding experiments inspired by *The Nature of Code* by Daniel Shiffman.  
Each project explores how complex behaviors emerge from simple rules — from flocking birds to evolutionary algorithms.

This repository serves as both a learning archive and a playground for generative systems, physics-based motion, and artificial life.
